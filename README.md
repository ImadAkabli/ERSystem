# Emergency System 
This program consists of implementing the notion of priority queues in heaps using arrays   
This program is sort of a emergency system to handle the most severe cases and get the chance to be treated first   
We have implemented the Insert, Print, Append, Sort functions in a different way and by using wrappers   

Was able to debugg all errors and seg faults by myself at 5 AM and feeling fresh
